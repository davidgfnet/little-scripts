little-scripts
==============

This repo is intended for little bash-like scripts which could
fall in the category of "miscellany".

Everyone should push clean, self-contained and self-explanatory
scripts which can be useful for everyday use or may be useful for
(just an example) set up some environment or build a project.

Any help is welcome ;) Just try to be clean and nice.

David
